## Next Steps

### Immediate (Do Now):

1. **Create Private GitHub Repository**
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Name: `LISTEN-website`
   - Visibility: **Private** ⚠️
   - Don't initialize with anything

2. **Push Website to GitHub**
   ```bash
   cd /users/PAS2062/delijingyic/project/LISTEN-website
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LISTEN-website.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Settings → Pages
   - Source: main branch, / (root)

4. **Test the Website**
   - Visit: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/LISTEN-website/`
   - Test the game: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/LISTEN-website/game.html`

### After Website is Live:

5. **Remove docs/ from Public Repo**
   ```bash
   cd /users/PAS2062/delijingyic/project/LISTEN
   git rm -r docs/
   git commit -m "Remove website files (moved to private repository)"
